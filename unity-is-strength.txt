Title:
 Unity is Strength

Story:
 This is a story of a teacher and his students. The teacher once taught a lesson of unity and its strength to his
 students. So, the teacher gave 1 stick to each of the 5 students and asked them to break it in half. The students
 broke the sticks very easily. Now, the teacher asked them to hold the 2 peices of the stick and break it again. The
 students did this very easily as well. Again the teacher asked them to hold those 4 pieces of the stick and break
 it. But this time the students were in trouble and could not easily break it.

Moral:
 No one can break you if you are united
